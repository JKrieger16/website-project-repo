<h1>Movies I like a lot.</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Blade Runner (1982)</h2>
<p>With a soundscape by Vangelis this movie is beyond atmospheric. It shows a 'possible future' where synthetic humans are commonly used, but have to be hunted down when they leave their programmed purpose by a special type of law enforcement officer called a "Blade Runner" Harrison Ford plays the character the movie follows, but his weak performance is one of the movies few downsides. The other actors in the movie are brilliant and the mood and tone is so well maintained. I think most people will find on watching that Gaff (Edward James Olmos) without saying a word really is the one leading the narritive and Roy Batty (Rutger Hower) deivers a scene that is entierly improvised but ends up being the centerpeice of the movie. (8/10)</p>
<h2>Dune (1984/2020)</h2>
<p>I'm just going to go ahead and give all of these a single entry on the list. I love all of them but for very diffrent reasons.</p>
<h3>1984</h3>
<p>The soundtrack for the movie was handled by Toto (Of Bless the rains down in africa fame) and they set the stage perfectly. There is also a lot of effort and time put into the very grand sets. David Lynch had a vision for a grand movie that would of been several hours long and honestly got butchered at the table so all that's left is the dream of what it could of been. It's a little wacky and overacted, a pure cheese film. But it has Pugs and Patric Stuwart (7.5/10)</p>
<h3>2020</h3>
<p>I love this movie. I'm going to incldue part 1 and 2 as this discussion because really it's all one story they just had to break it up, which is honestly what David Lynch should of been able to do in 1984, but it goes through Herbert's Narrtive taking a knife and cutting out things that just don't work anymore, updating it to a more timeless story. The music is A+++ and sets the bleak and lifeless scene on Arrakis. Villanue's use of color throughout the second film is also brilliant. Best performance of the Movie is Raban (Dave Bautista) for the absolute 180 that happens as soon as Feyd Rautha (Austin Butler who also was fantastic in every way) shows up. Javier Bardem is also amazing as the dry yet witty Stilgar. (9/10) </p>
<h2>The Mummy (1999)</h2>
<p>This movie is for bisexual Millenials and if you're not one then it's just not for you I think. (10/10)</p>
