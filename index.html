<p>Fam, I'm getting older. Please come celebrate another year that I haven't died with me and don't invite Thomas.</p>
<h3>Where we doing this shit?</h3>
<ul><li>7:30PM We are going to do the Sherrif's Office escape room at <a href="https://www.cluecarre.com/booking/book-metairie/">Clue Carre in Metairie</a></li>
    <ul><li>The cost is 32 a person</li>
    <li>We can have up to 10 people</li></ul>
<li>Then after that we are going to <a href="https://www.crazyhotpotla.com/">Crazy Hotpot</a> also in Metairie.</li>
            <ul><li>That is 29.99 a person plus drinks and tip.</li>
            <li>The place is all you can eat and has a lot of seafood but also non seafood options.</li>
            <li>The time depends on how long it takes us to solve the escape room.</li></ul>
<li>I hope you can make it. If you can please let me know.</li></ul>
